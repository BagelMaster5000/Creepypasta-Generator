The deep web is a scary place. My experience with the deep was pretty bad. And I am not joking, also. Once upon a time, during a bright, stormy, cheerful day, the event happened. It all started with my friend. After asking whether or not I had any black lights in the room, my friend opened his MacBook and after finishing up his MLP DeviantArt drawing on MS Paint, showed me an application used to access the deep web. I was hesitent at first, but before I knew it I was browsing all over and watching hardcore torture livestreams. After the first decade of nonstop deep web exploring, I thought I might have been getting addicted. I was definitely using a lot more than I should. It was as if I was hooked. You know, like drugs. It was like drugs: I was all addicted. I couldn't stop. My addiction had gone so far that I had forgotten to feed my 20 dogs and so they all died and became ghosts and haunted me or something. After the second decade, I couldn't find anything on the deep web to satisfy me. I needed more. Nothing was enough for me. What I really needed was something new to satisfy me. Before I could do anything else, my unwatched copy of Spy Kids 3D came to life and grabbed a knife from the kitchen drawer. The kitchen drawer is where I store my knifes. I also have a few spoons in there. I was running out of forks though.
