The deep web is a scary place. After the events I experienced throughout the past 21 days, I have realized that the deep web is not a place for normal people. Approxiametely 23.6 years ago, on a very very spooky, clear, cheerful day, my life changed forever. And after that day my life was never the same. What happened started with my friend. Slowly unzipping his hot...  steamy... leather macbook carrying case, he brought out one of his macbooks and after finishing up his mlp deviant art drawing on ms paint, showed me an application used to access the deep web. I grabbed his laptop and started browsing the various torture and gore porn livestreams. After a few hours of waiting for his macbook back, he just let me have it (since he has so many). Days, weeks, years, went by as I was browsing the most hardcore sections of the deep web. My addiction had gone so far I had forgotten to feed my 20 dogs and so they all died and became ghosts and haunted me or something. After the second decade, I realized I needed more than just torture livestreams to satisfy me needs. I needed more. Nothing was enough. And then, I had an idea. Then without any warning, a fire creature I think flew in through the window and grabbed a knife from a cake I was meaning to eat a decade ago.
