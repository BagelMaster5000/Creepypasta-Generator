The deep web is a scary place. After the events I experienced throughout the past 21 days, I have realized that the deep web is not a place for normal people. Approxiametely 23.6 years ago, on a very very dark, rainy, humid day, my life changed forever. And after that day my life was never the same. What happened started with my friend. Slowly unzipping his hot...  steamy... leather macbook carrying case, he brought out one of his macbooks and after finishing up his mlp deviant art drawing on ms paint, showed me an application used to access the deep web. I grabbed his laptop and started browsing the various torture and gore porn livestreams. After a few hours of waiting for his macbook back, he just let me have it (since he has so many). Days, weeks, years, went by as I was browsing the most hardcore sections of the deep web. I knew I was getting carried away when I started forgetting to eat, use the restroom, and sometimes even breath. And I was soooooo smelly my neighbor was getting annoyed and told me to kill myself. I knew it was time for something to change. After the second decade, I realized I needed more than just torture livestreams to satisfy me needs. I needed more. Nothing was enough. And then, I had an idea. Before I could do anything else, my unwatched copy of Spy Kids 3D came to life and grabbed a knife from the kitchen drawer. The kitchen drawer is where I store my knifes. I also have a few spoons in there. I was running out of forks though.
